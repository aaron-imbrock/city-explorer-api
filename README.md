# City-Explorer-API

**Author**: Aaron Imbrock
**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview

Here I begin building my own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application.

## Getting Started

    git clone git@github.com:aaron-imbrock/city-explorer-api.git
    cd city-explorer-api/
    touch README.md
    npm install
    npm -g install nodemon
    nodemon

    Create additional files as needed:

    ├── data
    │   └── weather.json
    ├── modules
    │   └── photos.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── README.md
    └── server.js
